# AI-Based Smart Alarm System

## Overview
An AI-based Smart Alarm System designed to analyze user sleep behavior and optimize wake-up timing. The system processes sleep data, applies basic machine learning concepts, and generates insights to improve alarm accuracy.

## Features
- User sleep data preprocessing and validation
- Behavioral pattern analysis
- Basic machine learning model for wake-up optimization
- Modular and scalable Python code structure

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Machine Learning (foundational)
- Data Processing (CSV)
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

## Project Structure
- smart_alarm_app.py – Main application logic
